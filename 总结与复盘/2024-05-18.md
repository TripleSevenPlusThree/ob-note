"When it comes to choosing how to get to Lhasa, I suggest you consider a self-driving trip."

"The slogan 'A Lifetime Must-Drive: Route 318' is not merely about the stunning scenery along the way. Choosing to embark on this journey by car is to challenge yourself, as Tibet's National Highway 318 is known as one of the most beautiful and challenging roads in the world.

Tibet's average altitude ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 meters, which is an incredibly daunting height."

this is my recommended route map.

Along the route 318，you  can admire a diverse range of natural landscapes。

but self driving will take you on an emotional rollercoaster, with highs and lows that leave you deeply moved.

it is amazing
