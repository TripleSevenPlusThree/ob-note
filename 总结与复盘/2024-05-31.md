Today, I'll be doing a movie  presentation, which is titled Peaceful Warrior, adapted from the novel Late Night Gas Station Meets Socrates. It is an amazing Story.

First of all, I have a question"Have you ever searched for the meaning of life? "The theme of this movie is centered on the “meaning of life”. 

The main character, Dan Millman, is a gymnastic genius, but even a man of his talent has to fight for it as hard as he can. He wakes up every night with nightmares. 

 He receives guidance from Socrates while scrubbing toilets. But he doesn't understand and eventually continues his restless life, but a car accident takes everything away. Even the coach who thinks the most highly of him urges him to give up. But Socrates said: a true warrior does not give up what he loves.
 
 I made a video to show the experience more vividly.Let is see the video.
 
 Finally, he resumed Socrates' guidance again, but this time, he began to contemplate the meaning of life with equanimity, focusing on the present moment. In the end, a man who once broke his leg won the national championship.
 
 Very inspirational and revealing story that makes us start to focus on what the meaning of life really is.
 
What is more, I do have one more thing.
Why was the movie renamed Peaceful warrior? Is it because the only way to find the meaning of life is through inner peace? I don't know. But I do know this:
		-       A true warrior always seeks from heart.
			A true warrior always stays true to what he loves.
			A true warrior is always focused on the moment.
			A true warrior is always in the process.
			A true warrior always rejects information that the brain doesn't need.
The answer is in our hearts.
