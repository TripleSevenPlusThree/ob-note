## 关于创造力启发
In fact，the insight occurs durin the reflection and relaxation that follows a period of intense activity.

When you are alone ,stop worrying and thinking.
Concentrate on you. 
Reflect about your work or particular project you are engaged in.
Revisit things during moments of relaxation after a period of intense work.
This  is when we are the most creative.


在一段时间的强度思考，工作下，停下来去放松，只专注于你的反思，这个时候是最优创造力的时候。

确实，对我自己而言，同样如此。
