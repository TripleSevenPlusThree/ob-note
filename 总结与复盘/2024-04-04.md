It is all known that friends have great impact on our lives. Thus, we launched an investigation with the aim of surveying my classmates's views on the significance of friendship in their lives and what qualities they value most in their friends.  
    
We collect ten classmate's answers. For the first question"Do you think friendship is an important part of your life? Why? ", all the classmates answered "yes" as I expected. An overwhelming majority of 80% of classmates give me the reason that friends can keep us company. Moreover, 10% of classmates think friends can make our lives pleasant and 10% think friends can help us. Based on the findings , it is obvious that the friendship is an vital part of our lives and it can alleviate our sense of loneliness or enrich our lives. 
   
The second question" In your opinion, what qualities do you value most in a friend?" Honesty and integrity were regarded essential as qualities by 80% of classmates when considering a friend. The other answer included kindness and good moral character. Through the result, we can see the importance of being honest and integrity.  

To sum up, the data highlights the importance of friendship. What's more, we also know the secret to maintaining a friendship is to keep good moral character and to be honest with our friends.
